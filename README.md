# Verilog_CPU
Simple MIPS CPU for Computer Achitecture and Design made in Verilog. 

This code was all made in Vivado 2016.2. In theory, it should work in other versions of Vivado or similar programs, but I can't make any guarantees. Set the top module to cpu5.v, or cpu5_testbench.v to test it. 

This was made as a final lab for EECE 3324 Computer Architecture and Organization at Northeastern University, taught by Dr. Julius Marpaung. 

It supports basic logic functions, immediates, LW, SW, sets, and branches in the MIPS assembly language.
